For the index file, the lowest average was a quality score of about 31.
I believe that if a single base has a q-score below 28 in the index files,
we should throw out the read because there are only 8 base pairs in an index
and a small error in a single nucleotide may refer to a different index.
For the sequence files, I believe that we should keep sequences that have an
average total base quality score of 35 because sequences

The number of indexes that contain undetermined base calls:
command: zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -c 'N'
index 1: 3976613
command: zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -c 'N'
index 2: 3328051
one-line command: zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -c 'N'
seq count: 7304664


Part2
Problem:
Index hopping occurs when a sequence's index swaps with another
index, which may cause undetermined index-pairs or incorrect library
assignment. De-multiplexing is crucial in order to clean up the data and
identify sequences that have undergone index hopping. The problem is to identify
and sort out sequences and indexes with a low quality score and isolate
sequences that have undergone index hopping. Index hopping is when both indexes
are in the known index list but are not the same.

Number of Files:
48+2+2 output files
24 indexes x 2 because of R1 and R2, 2 for unknown, and 2 for index hopping.

Informative Output:
An output file with run results would be highly beneficial to inform the user
if the de-multiplexing run was effective. A useful output should contain
the number of matched indexes, the number of read pairs per index, the
number of read pairs with index hopping, the number of read pairs with unknown
indexes. It would also be beneficial to show the percentage of the reads that
were matched indexes and the percentage of reads that were index hopped.
The line number for each file may also be helpful.

Test file case order:                   Output File:
Index contains 'N'                      Unknown File
Index has low quality score             Unknown File
Index hopping                           Hop File
Index is not in known dictionary list   Unknown File
Matched index par                       Index File
