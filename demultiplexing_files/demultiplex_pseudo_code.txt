Function Definitions:
1) Have a function that finds the reverse complement of a string.

def reverse_complement(string):
  '''translate a string of nucleotides to find the reverse complement'''
  return rc_string

Input: GTAGCGTA
Output: TACGCTAC

2) Have a function that takes in the sequence array and index, which will write
the record to a index file.

def write_record(record array, string):
  '''write the record to the proper file'''
  write to corresponding file "Seq_ID_F_Index1_Index2.fq" or
  "Seq_ID_R_Index1_Index2.fq"
  return nothing

Input: seq_record[], GTAGCGTA
Return: Nothing

3) Check if index Q-scores is within proper quality score cut off value

def check_index(index array)
  '''check if all of the index q-scores are above a specified value'''
  return bool (yes or no)

Input: index_array[]
Return: True or False

4) Check if the average of a sequence Q-scores is above a cut off value

def check_sequence(sequence array)
  '''check if the sequences average q-score is above a specific value'''
  return bool

Input: seq_array[]
Return: True or False

5) Check if the indexes are in the known index list

def valid_index(index1, index2)
  '''check if the indexes are in the known index list'''
  return bool

Input: GTAGCGTA, CGATCGAT
Output: True or False


Pseudo Code:

Load the indexes into a dictionary with the value being a file handle.
Make a dictionary that keeps count of how many pairs per index-pair there is.

Loop through the file handles and open all of the files.
  Index file names: "INDEX_R1, INDEX_R2" for all 24 indexes
                    "Unknown_R1, Unknown_R2, Hop_R1, Hop_R2"

Open the four zipped files.
  Store the first four lines of each file into a specified array.
  (have 4 arrays to store the record for each of the 4 files)
  Assign bool variables that run the Q-score checking functions.
  Assign bool variable to see if indexes are in known index list.
  If the q-score bool variables and index_check bool variable are all true:
    Find the reverse complement of Index 2 using a function.
    If the reverse complement of Index 2 is equal to index 1:
      Write the forward and reverse records to designated file using function.
    else:
      Write forward and reverse records to index hopped files.
  else:
    Write the records to unknown files.

Loop through the file handles and close all of the files.
